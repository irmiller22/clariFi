|------|--------|------------|
| Inconsistent CSV formats across banks | High | Build flexible parser with format detection; start with 2-3 major formats |
| Performance issues with large datasets | Medium | Implement pagination and virtual scrolling; optimize queries |
| Scope creep with AI features | Medium | Strict MVP definition; separate AI as post-MVP phase |
| Security vulnerabilities in file upload | High | Implement strict validation, file size limits, and sanitization |
| Learning curve with new technologies | Low | Allocate time for learning; leverage documentation and tutorials |

---

## 10. Open Questions

1. Should we support multiple CSV files in a single session?
2. What is the desired retention period for uploaded data?
3. Should we support export functionality (transactions back to CSV)?
4. What specific bank CSV formats should we prioritize?
5. Should we include receipt/attachment upload capability?
