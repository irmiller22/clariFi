# clariFi (Clarity Finance)

## Background

This is a finance tool created by Ian Miller primarily to refresh knowledge around Python, JS / React, and AI best 
practices.

The application is a simple CSV parser that breaks down a CSV upload of finance transactions, and
provides an Analytics UI for the user to break down and review transactions.
